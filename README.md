# SEO-Project
This is my first coding project. Throughout this, I've used learnings throughout the first week to collectively create the files. This first challenge has been a collection of editing files, simplifying the css files, and making this website more accesible for those who have difficulty looking at a website. 

I have had two tutoring sessions, attended office hours, looked up guidance on websites such as W3 Schools, and utilized the knowledge from classmates who are also working on this first challenge. 

I've learned to take one step at a time in this process. Instead of multitasking multiple areas, it's best to do baby steps to prevent any bugs within the code. I also have an excellent grasp of how to create branches and push into the main repo.
